## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Create Supabase Project**

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click **"Start your project"**
3. Create a new project:
   - **Name**: `CommUnity Storage`
   - **Database Password**: Choose a strong password
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
4. Wait for project to be ready (1-2 minutes)

### 2. **Get Your Credentials**

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
2. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon public key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`)

### 3. **Update Environment Variables**

Replace the placeholders in your `.env` file:

```env
# Replace these with your actual Supabase values
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 4. **Create Storage Bucket**

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. Create bucket:
   - **Name**: `community-files`
   - **Public bucket**: ‚ùå **NO** (keep private for security)
4. Click **"Create bucket"**

### 5. **Set Up Security Policies**

1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies**
2. Click **"New policy"** for the `community-files` bucket
3. Use this SQL policy:

```sql
-- Allow users to upload files to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload to own folder" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'community-files' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to view files in their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'community-files' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to delete files in their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'community-files' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### 6. **Enable Authentication (Optional)**

If you want to use Supabase Auth instead of Firebase:

1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Disable **"Enable email confirmations"** for testing
3. Configure providers as needed

## üß™ **Testing Your Setup**

### 1. **Start Your App**
```bash
cd CommUnity
npm start
```

### 2. **Test File Upload**
1. Go to **"Files"** tab
2. Click **"üóÇÔ∏è Upload to Supabase (Free)"**
3. Select any file (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, image)
4. Watch it upload to Supabase Storage
5. File appears in your list immediately

### 3. **Verify in Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **community-files**
2. You should see folders named with user IDs
3. Inside each folder, you'll see the uploaded files

## üîß **Configuration Options**

### File Size Limits
Edit `config/supabase.ts`:
```typescript
maxFileSize: 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100MB (adjust as needed)
```

### Allowed File Types
Edit the `allowedTypes` array in `config/supabase.ts` to add/remove file types.

### Storage Bucket Name
Change `STORAGE_BUCKET` in `config/supabase.ts` if you used a different bucket name.

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Error: "Invalid JWT"**
- Check your `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is correct
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in your `.env` file

### **Error: "Bucket not found"**
- Verify bucket name matches `STORAGE_BUCKET` in config
- Check bucket was created successfully in Supabase dashboard

### **Error: "Permission denied"**
- Verify storage policies are set up correctly
- Check user is authenticated before uploading

### **Files not appearing**
- Check Firestore rules allow read/write access
- Verify file metadata is being saved to Firestore
